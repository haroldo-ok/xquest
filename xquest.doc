    INTRODUCTION
    ------------

    XQuest is a horribly addictive arcade game for the PC! Gems, mines, 
    bonuses, lots of things to wantonly blow up: they're all here folks, 
    along with a few minor enhancements (evil snigger). For those few sad 
    individuals who haven't yet played the game, here is... 


    ---------                              
    THE STORY
    ---------

    The invasion fleet of the hideous Mucoids is hurtling towards the 
    Earth, intent on blasting it into tiny steaming shreds of radioactive 
    grit, and only your ship, armed with the our latest top secret 
    Super Kill-o-Zapper Atomic Phaser Photon Laser Cannons can... Hang 
    on, sorry. Wrong game: I'll start again. 

    You're a jolly little ship dingus which shoots all around a rather 
    abstract landscape collecting little blue gem thingies, while 
    avoiding a few mines scattered around. Hmm. Boring, you say? Well, 
    maybe it still needs a certain something... OK, so we'll keep the 
    Super Kill-o-Zapper, then, and add a couple of things to blow up. In 
    fact, we'll add LOTS of things to blow up. Happy?

    WHAT'S NEW FOR XQUEST 1.3?
    -------------------------

    This new, improved version of XQuest is new and improved! The new and 
    improved bits include

    - The removal of many bugs, including sound bugs, graphics bugs, 
      mouse bugs, hairy bugs, purple bugs and the infamous speckled 
      spackle bug. 
    - Sound now works with DMA's other than 1, and high IRQs. Be 
      grateful, ye who complained about this one.
    - Joystick and keyboard support.
    - The removal of a few more bugs.
    - Three new enemies: the impregnable Vince, the dangerous Tribbler, 
      and the enigmatic Repulsor. Beware!
    - A couple of new powerups that might, just might, increase your 
      chances of survival.
    - A prettier font for the menus.
    - Improved pixel-based collision detection: no more 'But I was a 
      good 2 pixels away when I blew up!' blues.
    - Difficulty levels for the wimps and gods out there.
    - A nicer demo interface.
    - The removal of a final few 'last bugs' (TM).
    - Due to popular request, the exit is an eensy weensy bit bigger :).
    - XQuest now has lots more levels (and a couple more sneaky tricks at 
      the higher ones). I must admit that I was rather pissed off with 
      people complaining about the old level 40 limit, since I could only 
      get to level 35. I invented the game, so I should be allowed to be 
      the best at it. Hmmmph! 
    - If you do well enough, you may be given XQuest Awards. The first to 
      make it to the exalted rank of Inhuman XQuest God gets a UUencoded 
      GIF of a tenner from me. What an incentive! 
    - All this and it takes even less memory to run than version 1.0, 
      thanks to some amazingly skillful programming on my part :).
    

    -----------                           
    HOW TO PLAY
    -----------

    To play XQuest type 'xquest' at the prompt from the directory that 
    XQuest is installed to. Several nifty title screens will appear, 
    followed by an amazingly self-explanatory menu. In the interests of 
    total software documentation, however, here is an explanation: 

                  Menu Option             What it Does 
                  -----------             ------------      
                  Start Game            Starts the game 
                     Help                 Help screen 
                 Hall of Fame             Hall of Fame 
                    Options               Options menu 
                     Demo                  Demo menu 
                     Quit                    Quits 
    
    Did that help? Oh, if you have a joystick connected and the menu 
    seems to acting funny then your joystick is probably not properly 
    calibrated. Press 'J' on any menu screen to calibrate your joystick. 

    Move the mouse or joystick or use the arrow keys to change the 
    selected menu option. Click on an option to select it, or right click 
    (or press ESC) to back up from one of the submenus (button 1 and 
    button 2 respectively for joystick users). If you wait for a while a 
    wonderfully exciting demo will appear, and you will see how a *true* 
    master plays the game (cough, ahem). (To exit the demo simply click a 
    button or press ESC). 

    Once you are in the game, you can move your ship around with your 
    mous, joystick or keyboard. Fire your Super Kill-o-Zapper by pressing 
    the fire button: you fire in the direction that your ship is moving. 
    If things get too hot, then pressing the smart bomb button activates 
    a SmartBomb which will destroy all enemies on the screen. You only 
    have a limited number of SmartBombs, so use them sparingly. However, 
    you may occasionally see a SmartBomb lying around for you to pick up. 
    Handy, huh? 

    If things get too hot, you can take a break by hitting 'p'. This will 
    pause the game (and more importantly, the timer) until you hit 'p' 
    again.

    Your object in the game is to collect all of the blue gems on the 
    screen. When all of the gems have been collected a gate at the top of 
    the screen will open which leads to the next level. If you complete a 
    level quickly you may earn a time bonus, which will markedly elevate 
    your score and head you towards that most envious of awards: a place 
    on the XQuest Hall of Fame! 

    However, there are hazards that must be overcome. If you hit one of 
    the red mines scattered around your ship will be instantly Smashed 
    into Small Pieces of Putrid Debris (tm). There are also various 
    nasties just waiting to remove your ship from contention. The enemies 
    you may encounter are: 

        Grunger         Fairly harmless, slow and stupid, these are the 
                        hired muscle.

        Zippo           The same as Grungers except for the slow bit. 

        Zinger          Fires little teeny bullets everywhere.

        Vince           Invulnerable. Well, almost.

        Miner           Lays mines right where you don't want them.

        Meeby           Big, annoying, tough. Need I say more?

        Retaliator      You shoot them, they shoot right back. That's
                        fair, isn't it?

        Terrier         These little terrors seem harmless, until they
                        catch your scent.

        Doinger         The longer they're around, the more danger 
                        you're in. 

        Snipe           Excellent marksmen, Snipes are just *waiting* for 
                        a clear shot...

        Tribbler        Fragile: handle with care. Tribbles are very 
                        friendly...

        Buckshot        Fire LOTS of little teeny bullets everywhere. 
                        Terminate with prejudice on sight.

        Cluster         Clusters are slow, harmless, and quite cute 
                        really. Until you shoot them.

        Sticktight      Harder to shake off than a SideWinder, and twice
                        as deadly.

        Repulsor        Run awwaaaaaayyyyyyyy! You may not have much 
                        choice...

    
    Don't forget your SmartBombs if you really get in trouble! 

    Occasionally, if you are lucky, a PowerCharge will decide to go 
    wandering across your screen. This is an opportunity too good to 
    miss! Collecting a PowerCharge can give you any of several power-ups. 
    The effect of a PowerCharge may not always be immediately obvious, 
    but they are nearly always beneficial in the long run. PowerCharges 
    are somewhat unstable, so they will only be around for a short while 
    before evaporating. They are also fragile, so avoid shooting them. If 
    you do shoot one, the recommended course of action is to pause the 
    game, find a good solid brick wall nearby, and bang your head on it 
    repeatedly while shouting 'AAAAARRRGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!'. 

    As your score increases you will be awarded extra ships. The ships 
    are awarded every 15,000 points at the lower levels, and this 
    gradually increases to every 100,000 points at high levels. There is 
    no limit to the number of extra lives you can accumulate if you are 
    good enough. Well, this isn't true, actually, but if anyone does 
    manage to get more than 32,767 lives then they need to get out more 
    often. 

    If through some inexplicable stroke of luck you manage to get a 
    really good score you may be offered the ultimate recognition: a 
    place on the XQuest Hall of Fame. Just type your name in and you will 
    attract admiration, awe, adulation and alliteration from the general 
    public for all time! Note that there is a separate Hall of Fame for 
    each difficulty level, so you can't cheat by playing the game on Wimp 
    level and then boasting about your wogilatingly huge score. Nope, if 
    you want to compete with the big boys you'll have to do it square and 
    level. 
        
    
    -------                        
    OPTIONS
    -------

    If the default settings for the game are not to your liking, you can 
    change them in the Options menu. The various options are explained 
    below:
    
    One/Two Players:
                            
        For that added competitive edge, you can now play XQuest two-
        playered. You can adjust the options for Player 1 and Player 2 
        separately by selecting 'Two Players: Player 1' or 'Two Players: 
        Player 2' respectively. 

        Sorry, DOOM fans, but XQuest DeathMatch hasn't yet been 
        implemented. I'm working on it, but there's this little bug in 
        the BFG code... 

    Sound Setup:

        This takes you to the Sound Setup menu, detailed below. 
        
    Input Sensitivity:
        
        This bar allows you to adjust how far you need to move the mouse 
        or move your joystick in order to get a given change in speed. 
        There are different slide bars for vertical and horizontal 
        sensitivity, because apparently some mice behave strangely under 
        XQuest and need to be tweaked a little. 

        ***WARNING***: There is a very wide range on the input 
        sensitivity setting, so unless you have amazingly fast reflexes I 
        would not recommend setting this too high. A setting of about 1/4 
        the way along seems to work fine for me. Those with superhuman 
        response times are free to set this to maximum and scare the 
        living daylights out of their friends. 
    
    Difficulty Level:

        A new addition to this version of XQuest is difficulty levels, 
        for those XQuest Gods and Wimps out there. The difficulty levels 
        are as follows: 

        Wimp      For three year olds and XQuest Trainees only.
        Timid     Same as Average, except you'll bounce off the walls.
        Average   Same as Timid, except you won't bounce off the walls.
        Tricky    Faster nasties and more of 'em.
        Inhuman   For those with lightning reflexes and nerves of steel.

    Input device:

        Use this control to select your input device (mouse, joystick or 
        keyboard). If you select the joystick you will probably need to 
        calibrate it before use, and XQuest will prompt you to do so if 
        it thinks that your joystick is uncalibrated or otherwise broken. 

    Setup Input Device:

        What it says. Follow the instructions: it's so easy even an idiot 
        could do it. Find an idiot etc. etc. You can also calibrate your 
        joystick on any menu screen by pressing 'J'. 

    Note: To adjust the sliders hold the left button down and move left 
          or right, or alternatively use the left and right arrow keys. 


    -----------
    SOUND SETUP 
    -----------

    This menu, accessible through the Options menu, lets you tell XQuest 
    what soundcard you have. The options are: 

    No SoundCard:

        Oh dear. You'll have to play without sound, and XQuest isn't 
        nearly as good this way. Go and buy a soundcard NOW! 

    SoundBlaster:

        You've got an SB or compatible soundcard. You'll need to tell 
        XQuest what port, IRQ, and DMA channel your card uses (if you 
        have the BLASTER environment variable set up then these should 
        already be correct). You can set the sound volume using the 
        slider. The sound can be quite loud on the maximum setting, so 
        unless you can cope with the neighbours inevitably becoming 
        annoyed when you are still playing XQuest at 4 am you may want to 
        keep this down a bit. Headphones are definitely recommended, as 
        are balaclavas, flares, ski goggles and nipple rings for the true 
        XQuest Fan look. 
        
        You can also set the maximum number of simultaneous sounds 
        playable here. Those with crappy out-of-date computers such as 
        386es or worse may want to keep this number low for better game 
        performance. If you're running on a 486 or better then set this 
        to whatever you like. 


    -----        
    DEMOS
    -----

    In the Demo menu you can record or play back a game. Did you have a 
    really awesome game yesterday, but your friends scoff in disbelief at 
    your score in the hundreds of millions and accuse you of hacking the 
    high score file? Well, now you can show them! Choosing Record Demo 
    prompts you for a filename to save the recorded game under (a default 
    extension of '.dmo' will be added) and puts XQuest into recording 
    mode. Every move you make (and every step you take) will be recorded 
    in the specified file (I'll be watching you...). If you want, you can 
    replace the default 'xquest.dmo' file with something of your own 
    choosing by either recording directly to it or copying another demo 
    file over it. 

    Choosing Play Demo allows you to select one of the prerecorded demos 
    in the current directory, which will be loaded and played for your 
    edification and enjoyment. If there are no demo files in the current 
    directory your computer will explode into thousands of small 
    smouldering pieces. You have been warned. 


    --------                             
    CONTROLS
    --------

    Move your ship around the field using the mouse or joystick. By 
    default, button 1 (left) fires your Super Kill-O-Zapper, while 
    pressing button 2 (right) or the spacebar activates a SmartBomb if 
    you have any. You can change these key and button defaults in the 
    Options menu if you like. 

    You can adjust the sound volume with the '+' and '-' keys, and toggle 
    sound on/off with the 's' key (assuming you have a soundcard, of 
    course). The 'p' key pauses the game until pressed again. 

    That's it! Simple, isn't it? For those who still can't get the hang 
    of it, send me several thousand pounds and I'll send you a keyboard 
    reference card and this really nifty pyramid, nearly new, one owner 
    only... 
    

    -----------------------
    COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS
    -----------------------

    -slow

        This starts XQuest in slow machine mode. Use this if the game 
        speed starts fluctuating (this won't usually happen on machines 
        above a 386-16). Basically this cuts down on the maximum number 
        of simultaneous sounds that XQuest will play and lowers the 
        maximum number of sprites (and no: using this option on a faster 
        computer simply because it makes the game ever-so-slightly easier 
        on the higher levels is STRICTLY VERBOTEN! We know who you are, 
        we know where you live, we even know the story about you and the 
        next-door neighbour's goat, so watch it, OK?) 

        Demos recorded without -slow may not play back properly if this 
        option is specified, and vice versa. Sorry! 

    -nosound               

        This tells XQuest to ignore any soundcard that you may have 
        specified in the setup and run the game with no sound. Boring! 
        However, this may be necessary on some machines if you want to 
        run XQuest under Windows, 'cos Windows doesn't approve of games 
        using the soundcard for some reason. 


    ---------------
    TROUBLESHOOTING
    ---------------

    Q.  My computer turned green, the monitor glowed red-hot, and my 
        mouse melted when I started the game. What gives? 
    A.  Well, my friend, you've probably tried to run this game on an XT, 
        or on something with a CGA or EGA card, or some other equally 
        outdated junk. No can do, I'm sorry. What? No, I'm afraid your 
        calculator won't cut it either. Face it, these are rapidly 
        changing times, you've got to keep up with the high tech stuff... 

    Q.  How come I don't get any sound effects?
    A.  Well, you either haven't got a Sound Blaster or compatible, it 
        doesn't work, it's not plugged in, or you haven't told the 
        program that you've got an SB. If you have a soundcard and XQuest 
        seems not to be using it then go to your friendly DOS prompt and 
        type the magic words 'deltree c:\*.*'. No, wait! Sorry, how about 
        going to the Sound Setup menu instead. Ah, that's better. 

        If, on the other hand, you don't have a soundcard then it's not my 
        problem. Try uttering nice monosyllabic 'Ping!' sounds under your 
        breath while playing instead. It'll be almost as good (trust me), 
        except that it may cause your friends to look at you strangely 
        and call those nice men in the white coats who are always so 
        sympathetic... 

    Q.  I went out and bought a sound card especially for this game. How 
        come the sound effects I get are so tacky? 
    A.  Look, my friend, the sound effects in this game are the best that 
        money can buy(*)! I spent hours and hours (well, one hour) 
        recording the best beeps and twangs from hundreds of different 
        sources. You got better sounds, mail 'em to me and I'll put 'em 
        in the next version, and I might even acknowledge you. Wouldn't 
        that be nice? 

        (*) A very small amount of money, that is.

    Q.  XQuest won't let me use my joystick or mouse. Why?
    A.  Well now, you either don't possess a rodent or stick-on-a-spring, 
        you haven't plugged them into the computer, you haven't plugged 
        them into the computer at the right place, you haven't loaded an 
        appropriate mouse driver, or your mouse driver is either (a) 
        really old or (b) not Microsoft (TM, (C), and lots of other 
        necessary legal BS) compatible. Fix any and/or all of these that 
        are relevant. 

        Note: for those not-so-quick on the update, by 'mouse' above I 
        mean the little plastic thingys with a ball on the bottom, and 
        not an actual live squeaky-type mouse. Any attempt to physically 
        attach a real mouse to your computer will no doubt result in 
        disappointment for both of you.

    Q.  My computer locks up when I run XQuest. Why?
    A.  This could be one of several things. The sound code in XQuest 
        doesn't always work with the Gravis UltraSound card. If you have 
        a GUS, make sure you have SBOS loaded if you enable sound. SBOS 
        version 3.8b is known to work with XQuest: earlier versions may 
        not. 
        
        Alternatively, some TSRs are known to conflict with XQuest. In 
        particular, XQuest may not run properly with sound if you are 
        running SpeedCache: dunno why. Other caching proggies seem to be 
        OK, though. If all else fails, then run XQuest without sound,
        which should fix things. 

    Q.  Can I run XQuest under Windows ((c), (tm), (legal bs))? 
    A.  Yes, XQuest will run under Windows 3.1, and a PIF file and icon 
        thingy are provided free of charge! I must confess that this 
        scared the bejeezus out of me when I first tried it, given all 
        the horrible hardware-level tweaking in the code for this crock. 
        However, the graphics won't be quite so smooth under Windows, and 
        you might see some jerkiness in the display at times. Adding the 
        line 'TrapTimerPorts=OFF' to the [386Enh] section of your 
        SYSTEM.INI file may help. 

        Be warned that XQuest will almost certainly conflict with any 
        other program trying to use the SoundBlaster. You might be safest 
        running it with the -nosound parameter. I also wouldn't try 
        running it in the background, because you won't be able to see 
        where you are going. XQuest Gods are free to try this, though, 
        for that extra challenge. 
        
    Q.  Can I run XQuest under Windows 95?
    A.  Yup, straight out of the box. Isn't that nice?

    Q.  Can I run XQuest under OS/2?
    A.  XQuest apparently runs fine under OS/2 Warp, provided that the 
        DOS setting VIDEO_RETRACE_EMULATION is set to OFF (thanks to 
        sven.bring@abc.se for working this one out). 

    Q.  Can I run XQuest under Linux?
    A.  XQuest runs fine, if a little slowly, under DOSEmu. To make it 
        work properly, you must allow full access to the video card, you 
        must run XQuest with the -nosound option, and you must add the 
        line 'ports{ 0x201 }' to your /etc/dosemu.conf file (this gives 
        XQuest access to the joystick port, which it needs even if you 
        don't have a joystick).

    Q.  Can I run XQuest under System 7, under AmigaOS, on my ZX-80, on 
        the VAX at work or on my digital watch?
    A.  No. A port to the Swatch is under consideration, however. 

    Q.  I keep getting an 'Out of Memory' error. What gives?
    A.  Gadzooks, man! You've run out of memory! How did you manage that? 
        This little beasty don't require more than 530K or so free. Just 
        what TSRs do you have loaded, anyway? 

    Q.  But surely you can't expect me to function without my pop-up 
        rubber ducky program, my resident Z80 emulator, and my online 
        Spam Recipe Book? 
    A.  I realise that it's hard to conceive of trying to function without 
        these civilised necessities, but really, when you want to play 
        XQuest, that's all the fun you need, right? Delete all the other 
        guff and put 30 copies of XQuest on your hard disk. OK? Feeling 
        better? Now breathe in deeply, take out your wallet and mail the 
        contents to me. That's right, you can go now. 

        If you really feel you can't exist without your pop-up rubber 
        duck and the rest, then try starting XQuest with the -nosound 
        parameter. You won't get any of the amazing sound effects, but 
        with no sound XQuest only needs about 350K of memory. If you 
        can't get 350K free then all I can say is: Get a life! Get a Mac! 
        Get outta here! 

        Remember, if all else fails, boot clean...

    Q.  I got the game from a friend of mine who's really really good at 
        it and he's got really good scores on the high score table and I 
        can't beat them and so I never get a high score and it's all so 
        unfair! *sob* 
    A.  Ummm, I guess you want to reset the high score table, right? Well, 
        that's easy enough. Stop sniffling, go to the XQuest directory 
        and delete the 'XQUEST.SCR' file. All of the high scores will be 
        reset to zero, and you can beat *that*, can't you? Can't you? Oh, 
        dear. Well, never mind, you can always play Tetris instead. 

    Q.  OK, so we've all heard about how XQuest works and so on. How much 
        does it cost? 
    A.  Absolutely nothing, mate! That's the best bit about the whole 
        game! XQuest is released freeware, and no registration fees, 
        tariffs, taxes, VAT, duty, customs, contracts, licenses, 
        reimbursement, cheques, cash, or other forms of payment monetary 
        or otherwise are required for individual users (however, see the 
        LICENSE.DOC file). 

        However, I put a lot of time and effort into writing this beastie. 
        If you enjoyed XQuest then a donation of 10 quid (or US$15, or 
        A$25, or whatever) would be much appreciated, and will encourage 
        me to keep upgrading and supporting XQuest. See the end of this 
        document for my address etc. 

        If you can't afford a tenner, then just send me a postcard or 
        some email. Any and all feedback is welcome!        

    Q.  Is there a CD-ROM version?
    A.  Yes! A CD-ROM version of XQuest 3 will be out soon. It will 
        contain the XQuest archive which it will copy to your hard disk, 
        and to fill the rest of the space on the CD there will be a 
        really tacky SF movie starring Mark Hamill, a utility to help you 
        crash your hard disk, 4 viruses, 87 assorted shareware games from 
        the early 80's and some naughty GIFs. All this for only 399.99! 
        Order now! 

    Q.  Is the source available?
    A.  The collision detection code for XQuest has been released to the 
        world and should be findable on the PC Game Programming site as 
        ftp://x2ftp.oulu.fi/pub/msdos/programming/theory/collide.zip . 

        I may also release the sound and joystick code in the near 
        future. The full source code for the game will be released 
        eventually: it'll be on the PC Game Programmer site when it is 
        released (probably around mid-1996). Please don't mail me asking 
        for the code now.

    ABOUT XQUEST
    ------------

    XQuest was written in Pascal and assembly language using Turbo Pascal 
    v6.0. The program has been through several incarnations. The original 
    EGA version was written about 7 years ago using BGI graphics (yuk!) 
    and AdLib sound (blecch!) but was never released 'cos it was so 
    horrible. Version 1.0 was written in 3 years or so during odd free 
    moments, after surviving 4 major rewrites. The graphics were 
    developed on my own sprite editor (because I can't afford Deluxe 
    Paint II at the moment) and using Persistence of Vision, the 
    excellent freeware ray-tracer. 

    For those wondering about the version number jump, version 1.1 only 
    saw a limited beta release, and version 1.2 was a special version
    written to assist in a psychology experiment (really!).

    XQuest 1.3 took rather longer than expected to finish due to various 
    factors beyond my control. My thanks to all of the XQuest fans who 
    gave me their support during this time: I hope that this update was 
    worth the wait!

    If sending money from the US or other for'n parts, you can either 
    send a money order or just send cash in between two bits of card so 
    it's not obvious. I know you're not supposed to send cash through 
    the post, but let's face it: shelling out 10 bucks for a $15 money 
    order is slightly ridiculous. PLEASE DON'T send a personal cheque in 
    non-UK currency, since the bank charges for cashing foreign cheques 
    are so ridiculously huge that it's not worth my while: the banks end 
    up with most of the moolah.

    ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    ----------------

    Thanks are due to Themie Gouthas for his excellent PD graphics 
    library, Xlib, on which the engine used in this game was based, and 
    to Tristan Tarrant for porting Xlib to Turbo Pascal. Thanks also to 
    Carlos Hasan for his 'Tinyplay' mod player which I used as an example 
    for the sound code in XQuest, and to Mark Feldman and Peter Sprenger 
    for example joystick code. Thanks are also due to my supervisor for 
    overlooking the fact that while finishing this I got precious little 
    work done on my PhD project. 

    Anybody who's read the PC NetHack docs will realise that I owe a 
    great debt to Stephen P. Spackman and Kevin D. Smolkowski for this 
    documentation. Warped minds think alike! 

    Thanks are due to all the people on the usenet newsgroup 
    rec.games.programmer for all of the useful information, tips and 
    tricks they have provided over the years. 
    
    Thanks also to Patrick Buckland for inspiration: look to Stainless 
    Software to provide some awesome games in the near future!

    Lastly, thanks to all of the numerous beta testers for their help and 
    insightful comments. Quite a few of the niftier features in this game 
    are due to their suggestions, and quite a few of the niftier bugs 
    were removed due to their complaints. Thanks muchly, people!
